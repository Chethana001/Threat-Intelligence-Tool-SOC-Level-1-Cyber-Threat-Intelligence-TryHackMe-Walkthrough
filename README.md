Threat Intelligence Tools— SOC Level 1 -Cyber Threat Intelligence — TryHackMe Walkthrough
## Task one : Room Outline
This room will cover the concepts of Threat Intelligence and various open-source tools that are useful. The learning objectives include:

* Understanding the basics of threat intelligence & its classifications.
* Using UrlScan.io to scan for malicious URLs.
* Using Abuse.ch to track malware and botnet indicators.
* Investigate phishing emails using PhishTool
* Using Cisco's Talos Intelligence platform for intel gathering.

## Task two : Threat Intelligence
### What is Threat Intelligence?

It’s basically detective work for cyberattacks.
You collect clues (data) about bad guys trying to hack companies or governments, then figure out who they are, why they’re coming, and how to stop them.

### To stop the bad guys, ask 4 simple questions

1. Who’s trying to break in?
(A hacker group? A country? A disgruntled ex-employee?)\
2. Why do they want in?
(Steal money? Spy? Cause chaos? Ransom?)\
3. What tools and skills do they have?
(Are they using sneaky phishing emails? Super advanced malware?)\
4. What clues should we look for?
(Weird login attempts? Strange files? Warning signs on our systems?)
